          <span className="text-red-700 font-bold">eCalc</span> is a powerful
          industry-standard tool to calculate various metrics about custom
          vehicles. We use eCalc to measure and optimize battery weight, battery
          power, propeller diameter, propeller pitch, motor KV, and ESCs.
        </p>
        <p>
          With eCalc, we first{" "}
          <span className="text-red-700 font-bold">fine-tune</span> our drone‚Äôs
          parameters to ensure maximal performance for drone. Then we move on
          the designing and building.

      </DDItem>

      <DDItem name="3D Modeling" resource="/hardware/frame.jpg" right={false}>
        <p>
          Once our optimal drone has been configured using eCalc, we then move
          on to designing the frame in 3D CAD software.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use <span className="text-red-700 font-bold">SolidWorks</span> to
          precisely measure and machine drone parts, include motor plates,
          mounting brackets, and component housing. Here's one of the models we
          built for the central plate.

          One of our most pivotal decisions was to build a{" "}

          year‚Äôs competition. Our team considered various other form factors,
          like a hexacopter and a coaxial quadcopter.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we settled on the quadcopter because we calculated that a
          lightweight, fast drone would be able to complete the multi-lap course
          more efficiently.

          To safely drop each payload, we considered various different options,

          they require the drone to be hovering in place for longer.

The procurement of all essential electronic components was finalized, and the intricate process of wiring and soldering these components onto the power distribution board (PDB) and flight controller began. Recognizing potential performance advantages, we became engaged with specialized manufacturers to develop custom planetary gearboxes tailored to the chosen motors and propellers. The airdrop mechanism underwent a significant design iteration, with a precision prototype being fabricated to identify and rectify remaining mechanical integration issues. Initial functional prototypes of the landing gear were 3D printed for structural evaluation. The development of the parachute recovery system progressed with the construction and testing of cloth-based parachute prototypes at lower altitudes. The imaging team achieved a refined state with their primary object detection model, completing extensive fine-tuning using both general and custom-annotated datasets. Recognizing limitations in standard image processing for mapping, the team began researching advanced, machine learning-driven image stitching methods, exploring transformer networks and relevant literature. The autopilot team transitioned to integrating and testing new, higher-performance hardware, including the advanced Pixhawk 6X flight controller, high-resolution cameras, and lidar sensors, and began generating complex flight paths optimized for both mapping and airdrop missions. A key area of development focused on the seamless integration of camera triggering and data acquisition into the autonomous mission planning software via the MAVLink Camera V2 Protocol, enabling precisely timed image capture.
